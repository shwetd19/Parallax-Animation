# Parallax-Animation
## Here are some technical code learnings from the provided code:

1. The code imports two components from the **`@react-spring/parallax`** library: **`Parallax`** and **`ParallaxLayer`**. These components enable creating parallax effects on web pages, where the background moves slower than the foreground to create a sense of depth.
2. The **`useRef`** hook is used to create a reference to the **`Parallax`** component. This reference is assigned to the **`parallax`** constant.
3. The **`Parallax`** component is wrapped in a **`div`** element with a style object that sets the width, height, and background color of the web page.
4. The **`Parallax`** component has three pages, as specified by the **`pages`** prop.
5. The **`ParallaxLayer`** components are used to create different layers of the parallax effect. Each **`ParallaxLayer`** has an **`offset`** prop, which specifies the vertical position of the layer relative to the viewport. The **`speed`** prop determines how fast the layer moves relative to the other layers.
6. The **`factor`** prop is used to create a zoom effect on the background layer. A higher **`factor`** value will make the layer appear closer.
7. The **`onClick`** props of some **`ParallaxLayer`** components are used to scroll to different pages of the parallax effect when clicked. This is accomplished using the **`scrollTo`** method of the **`Parallax`** reference created with **`useRef`**.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the **`@react-spring/parallax`** library to create a parallax effect on a web page with multiple layers and background images. 
It also shows how to use the **`useRef`** hook to create a reference to a component and how to use the **`onClick`** prop to handle user interaction.
